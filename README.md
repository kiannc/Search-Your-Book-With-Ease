**Due to security reason, we are unable to connect with the National Library API**

## Conclusion
We are unable to develop a fully working prototype due the the time constraint. However, if we have the time we would like to work on it and make this application fully functional. Do drop me an email if you have any questions/bugs found in the program. Thank you !
